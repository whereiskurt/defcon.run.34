## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from requirement clusters -- scaffold/picker, flash, config+API, deployment
- [Roadmap]: SRVR requirements grouped with CONF (Phase 3) because config push depends on server API for secrets
- [Research]: Serial port handoff between flash (esptool.js) and configure (@meshtastic/core) is highest technical risk -- Phase 2/3 boundary

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Serial port handoff between Phase 2 (flash) and Phase 3 (configure) requires careful port release/reopen choreography
- Exact Meshtastic firmware version to pin is an event decision, not yet made
- Hardware-specific quirks (CH340 drivers, ESP32-C3 USB-JTAG) need testing with actual devices
